# File Renamer CLI Tool

A Python-based CLI utility for bulk renaming files in the current directory. It allows users to export file names to a text file, edit them in their preferred text editor, and apply these new names to the original files. The tool supports previewing changes, resetting names, and executing the rename operation directly from the command line.

## Features
- Export and edit file names in a text editor.
- Preview changes before applying.
- Bulk rename files with new names.

## Quick Start
1. **Run**: `python rename.py` in your terminal.
2. **Edit**: Use `t` to edit file names in the text editor.
3. **Preview**: Use `p` to see changes.
4. **Rename**: Use `r` to apply new names.
5. **Quit**: Use `q` to exit the tool.

Ensure Python 3 and `prompt_toolkit` are installed to use this tool.
